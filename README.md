# Dependency-Injection-Pattern-Application
In this application, dependency injection has been implemented on the .NET Core platform.

I applied the dependency injection technique, which is the basis of the dependency injection principle, in this application.

Basically we have the ITasit interface to be implemented. And in the Vasita class, I call the ITasit interface as a field and set it with the constructor, and then I write the Use method.

All that remains is to implement the ITasit interface in my classes such as Araba, Motor, Otobus and use it on the clint side.
